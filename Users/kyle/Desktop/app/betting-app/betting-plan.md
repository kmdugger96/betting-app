# 3Betting Platform Implementation Plan (Next.js, Tailwind, Drizzle, Clerk, Stripe, PostHog)

Below is a comprehensive plan for building a multi-sport betting analytics and fantasy advisory platform. This version is tailored to a stack centered on Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Drizzle ORM (with PostgreSQL), Clerk, Stripe, and PostHog, deployed to Vercel and optionally leveraging AWS or other cloud providers for supporting services.

## 1. Overview and Project Goals

The platform is a multi-sport betting analytics and fantasy advisory system designed to:
- Provide real-time odds and AI-driven bet suggestions.
- Support beginner and advanced bettors, as well as fantasy players.
- Offer tiered access (Free, Paid, Premium) with different feature sets.
- Enable community interaction through chat groups.
- Integrate user-provided fantasy data and track bets from external sportsbooks.

   - Auth checks, subscription logic, bet handling, and AI calls.
   - Integrated PostHog analytics for tracking.
3. **Database & Caching**  
   - PostgreSQL core data store.
   - Optional Redis layer for caching popular queries or real-time data.
4. **AI/ML Microservice** (Optional)  
   - Might be Python or Node for advanced statistical or ML-driven suggestions.
5. **Third-Party Integrations**  
   - Odds API for real-time odds, Stripe for payments, possible OCR for slip parsing.

## 4. High-Level Implementation Breakdown

### 4.1 Authentication & User Tiers

1. **Authentication**  
   - Handled via Clerk (sign-up/sign-in flows).
   - Age verification disclaimers at sign-up if necessary.
2. **Tier Logic**  
   - Store membership (free, paid, premium) in userâ€™s profile table.
   - Server actions verify membership before returning data.
3. **Payment & Subscription**  
   - Integrate Stripe monthly/annual subscriptions.
   - On success, upgrade membership in DB.

### 4.2 AI Suggestions & Bet Card Generation

1. **Request Flow**  
   - User inputs preferences (league, bet type), triggers a server action that calls an AI or in-process model.
2. **Model Processing**  
   - Combine DB stats + real-time odds from Odds API to produce recommendations.
3. **Caching**  
   - Popular queries can be cached with Redis.

### 4.3 Stats Page & Data Visualization

1. **Odds & Stats**  
   - Server actions fetch aggregated data from DB and external sources.
2. **Free vs Paid Visibility**  
   - Partial or blurred data for free-tier, full for paid/premium.

### 4.4 Bet Slip Tracking & Screenshot Upload

1. **Screenshot Upload**  
   - Premium-tier feature to upload bet slips for OCR (stored in S3 or similar).
2. **Bet Slip Management**  
   - DB table to store slip data; track statuses in real-time.
3. **Notifications**  
   - Alert user on status changes via push notifications or email.

### 4.5 Fantasy Advisory

1. **Roster Input**  
   - Users can input rosters or upload data for fantasy teams.
2. **Draft Simulations**  
   - Simulate picks based on scoring format, AI/ML for suggestions.

### 4.6 Layout Customization (Third Tier Feature)

1. **Drag-and-Drop**  
   - Premium users can rearrange dashboards in the client UI.
2. **Share Layouts**  
   - Possibly store layout config to share with other users via chat.

### 4.7 Community Chat & Groups

1. **Chat Basics**  
   - Real-time chat with WebSockets or Socket.io; DB for storage.
2. **Groups**  
   - Support group creation, membership invites, moderation.

### 4.8 Notifications & Alerts (Third Tier)

1. **Notification Settings**  
   - DB table to store user-specific alert preferences.
2. **Implementation**  
   - Use Twilio or FCM to send push notifications for critical updates.

## 5. Data Model Sketch

Example DB structure (simplified):

- **User**  
  - id (PK), email, membership (enum free/paid/premium), ...
- **BetSlip**

- **ChatGroup**  
  - id (PK), group_name, ...
- **ChatMembership**  
  - id (PK), group_id (FK), user_id (FK), ...

2. **Staging & Production**  
   - Deploy to Vercel; optional staging environment for QA.
3. **Monitoring & Logging**

   - Test server actions, subscription flows, basic UI logic.
2. **Integration & E2E**  
   - Validate sign-up, upgrading membership, placing a bet slip, chat usage.
3. **Performance & Load Tests**  
   - Evaluate high traffic scenarios, especially during major sporting events.
4. **AI Model Validation**  
   - If advanced modeling is included, track accuracy and refine models.
