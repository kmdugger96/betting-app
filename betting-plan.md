# Platform Implementation Plan (Next.js, Tailwind, Drizzle, Clerk, Stripe, PostHog)

333Below is a comprehensive plan for building a multi-sport betting analytics and fantasy advisory platform. This version is tailored to a stack centered on Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Drizzle ORM (with PostgreSQL), Clerk, Stripe, and PostHog, deployed to Vercel and optionally leveraging AWS or other cloud providers for supporting services.

---

## 1. Overview and Project Goals

The platform is a multi-sport betting analytics and fantasy advisory system designed to:
- Provide real-time odds and AI-driven bet suggestions.
- Support beginner and advanced bettors, as well as fantasy players.
- Offer tiered access (Free, Paid, Premium) with different feature sets.
- Enable community interaction through chat groups.
- Integrate user-provided fantasy data and track bets from external sportsbooks.

---

## 2. Proposed Tech Stack

### 2.1 Front-End

- **Next.js**:  
  - Provides server and client components to optimize performance and data-fetching patterns.
  - Utilizes **Server Actions** for streamlined server-side operations without needing Redux or separate API routes for many tasks.

- **Tailwind CSS**:  
  - Enables rapid UI development with utility-first styling.

- **Shadcn UI**:  
  - Offers a collection of reusable components, integrated seamlessly with Tailwind.

- **Framer Motion**:  
  - For animations and interactive UI experiences.

- **TypeScript**:  
  - Ensures type safety throughout the codebase.

### 2.2 Back-End

- **Node.js** (with Next.js server components):  
  - Drizzle ORM is used for straightforward database interactions within server components or server actions.

- **PostgreSQL**:  
  - Reliable, relational DB for storing user profiles, bets, chat messages, fantasy data, etc.

- **Drizzle ORM**:  
  - Simplified query building and migrations, integrated with Next.js server actions for data operations.

- **Optional Services**:  
  - **Redis** (if high-traffic caching is needed, e.g. for trending bets or real-time odds lookups).
  - **AI/ML** layer (optional microservice in Node.js or Python if advanced model-based suggestions are needed).

### 2.3 Infrastructure & DevOps

- **Deployment**:
  - **Vercel** for hosting the Next.js application.
  - Potentially **AWS** (S3 for file storage, Lambda for serverless, ECS for container-based microservices).
  
- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for testing, building, and deployments.

- **Notifications**:
  - **Twilio** or **FCM** for push notifications.
  - Apple/Google push notification services for mobile if using React Native apps.

- **Analytics**:
  - **PostHog** for tracking user interactions and page views.

---

## 3. Architecture and Data Flow

1. **Client (Next.js Web + Optional React Native App)**  
   - Users authenticate via Clerk and interact with a tailwind-based UI.
   - UI requests data from Next.js server actions or routes for ephemeral tasks.

2. **API / Server Actions**  
   - Next.js server actions handle user authentication, subscription logic with Stripe, tier checks, and calls to AI/ML endpoints.
   - PostHog integration for analytics.

3. **Database & Caching**  
   - PostgreSQL for core data (profiles, bets, chat, fantasy rosters).
   - Optional Redis for caching trending content or popular queries.

4. **AI/ML Microservice** (Optional)  
   - Processes advanced predictions (may be in Python or Node) behind a serverless or microservice endpoint.

5. **Third-Party Integrations**  
   - **Odds API** for real-time sports data.
   - **Stripe** for subscription payments.
   - **Screenshot OCR** (AWS Textract / Google Vision) if slip screenshots need parsing.

---

## 4. High-Level Implementation Breakdown

### 4.1 Authentication & User Tiers

1. **Authentication**  
   - Handled via Clerk for user sign-up/sign-in flows.
   - Age verification disclaimers included at sign-up.

2. **Tier Logic**  
   - Store membership level (free, paid, premium) in user’s profile.
   - Server actions check membership before returning data; free users see blurred or limited stats.

3. **Payment & Subscription**  
   - Stripe monthly/annual subscriptions.
   - On subscription success, upgrade membership and store details (e.g., `stripeSubscriptionId`) in DB.

---

### 4.2 AI Suggestions & Bet Card Generation

1. **Request Flow**  
   - User inputs league, bet type, risk level, team/player, etc.
   - A server action calls the AI microservice or in-process model to fetch predictions.

2. **Model Processing**  
   - Combine historical stats from the DB with real-time odds from the **Odds API**.
   - Return bets, rationale, and popularity metrics (for the flame icon).

3. **Caching**  
   - Cache popular queries in Redis if necessary.

---

### 4.3 Stats Page & Data Visualization

1. **Odds & Stats**  
   - Next.js server actions to fetch or aggregate data from the DB and Odds API.
   - Chart rendering via libraries like Recharts or Victory in client components.

2. **Free vs Paid Visibility**  
   - If user is free-tier, show partial data or blur the display to encourage upgrades.

---

### 4.4 Bet Slip Tracking & Screenshot Upload

1. **Screenshot Upload**  
   - For third-tier/premium users, optional screenshot feature.
   - Upload images to S3 or similar storage, run OCR, parse slip data.

2. **Bet Slip Management**  
   - Store slip details in the DB for real-time updates and notifications.

3. **Notifications**  
   - Third-tier users get push notifications about bet status changes.

---

### 4.5 Fantasy Advisory

1. **Roster Input**  
   - Manual input of players, or optional CSV import in the future.
   - Store rosters in DB keyed to user ID.

2. **Draft Simulations**  
   - Simulation logic in a server action with scoring format (PPR, half PPR).
   - Return recommended picks based on updated projections.

---

### 4.6 Layout Customization (Third Tier Feature)

1. **Drag-and-Drop**  
   - Let premium users rearrange dashboards in Next.js client components.
   - Persist layout settings in the user’s profile (JSON or a related table).

2. **Share Layouts**  
   - Possibly store a “layout config” to share with others in chat.

---

### 4.7 Community Chat & Groups

1. **Chat Basics**  
   - Implement WebSocket or Socket.io for real-time messaging.  
   - Store messages in DB with references to user ID, group ID.

2. **Groups**  
   - Everyone can add/remove members, rename, or mute the chat.

---

### 4.8 Notifications & Alerts (Third Tier)

1. **Notification Settings**  
   - DB table for user’s alert preferences (odds changes, injuries, bet slip updates, trending bets).
   - Push notifications via Twilio/FCM.
